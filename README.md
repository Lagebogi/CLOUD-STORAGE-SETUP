*Description* :

I logged into the AWS Management Console and navigated to the S3 service by searching for it. Once on the S3 Dashboard, I created a new S3 bucket, ensuring the name was unique and selecting an appropriate AWS region. I then configured the public access settings, keeping them private by default, and left encryption enabled for security. After successfully creating the bucket, I uploaded two files by selecting them from my local machine and starting the upload process. Once the files were uploaded, I adjusted the permissions by modifying the public access settings for the files, allowing them to be accessed via URL. To verify accessibility, I copied the Object URL of the uploaded files and opened them in a web browser, confirming they were accessible. Finally, I used the AWS CLI command aws s3 ls s3://my-s3-bucket-654321/ to list the uploaded files in the bucket, ensuring that everything was stored correctly. This process demonstrated how to create and configure an AWS S3 bucket, upload files, set permissions, and verify access using both the web interface and the CLI.
